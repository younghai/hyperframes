/**
 * compileStage — pure compile pass of `executeRenderJob`.
 *
 * Runs `compileForRender` on the entry HTML, folds the alpha-output and
 * render-mode-hint signals into a single `forceScreenshot` decision,
 * writes compiled artifacts to `workDir/compiled/`, builds the
 * `CompositionMetadata` view of the result, and resolves the
 * `deviceScaleFactor` for supersampling.
 *
 * The probe sub-stage (browser launch, duration discovery, recompile,
 * media reconciliation) lives in a sibling stage. This stage stops at
 * the point where the in-process renderer enters the `if (needsBrowser)`
 * branch.
 *
 * `forceScreenshot` is the only field on `cfg` that this stage writes,
 * and it is written exactly once: at the end of the stage, after
 * `compileForRender` has reported the composition's `renderModeHints`
 * and the orchestrator has told us whether the output format demands an
 * alpha channel. The resolved boolean is also returned on the stage's
 * result so downstream stages can consume the value as an explicit
 * parameter instead of reading `cfg.forceScreenshot` directly. See the
 * distributed-render plan §4.3 — `LockedRenderConfig.forceScreenshot`
 * is computed here and frozen for the rest of the pipeline.
 *
 * Hard constraints preserved verbatim from the in-process renderer:
 *   - `perfStages.compileOnlyMs` is set to wall-clock ms around the
 *     `compileForRender` call only.
 *   - The `log.info("Compiled composition metadata", ...)` line is emitted
 *     after writing artifacts, with the same payload shape as before.
 *   - The `log.info("Supersampling composition via deviceScaleFactor", ...)`
 *     line is emitted only when `deviceScaleFactor > 1`.
 *   - `applyRenderModeHints` short-circuits when the caller-supplied
 *     `alreadyForced` boolean is `true`, so the auto-select warn log
 *     fires only when the composition hint is the deciding factor —
 *     same behavior as before this PR.
